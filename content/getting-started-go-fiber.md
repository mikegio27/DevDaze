# Getting Started with Go and Fiber

Go (Golang) is a powerful programming language that's perfect for building web applications. When combined with the Fiber framework, you can create incredibly fast and efficient web servers.

## Why Choose Fiber?

Fiber is an Express-inspired web framework built on top of Fasthttp, the fastest HTTP engine for Go. Here are some key benefits:

- **Performance**: Built on Fasthttp, one of the fastest HTTP engines
- **Express-like**: Familiar API for developers coming from Node.js
- **Zero Memory Allocation**: Router with zero memory allocation
- **Middleware Support**: Rich ecosystem of middleware

## Basic Setup

First, initialize your Go module:

```bash
go mod init your-project-name
go get github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2
```

## Creating Your First Route

Here's a simple example of a Fiber application:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    app := fiber.New()

    app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
        return c.SendString("Hello, World!")
    })

    log.Fatal(app.Listen(":3000"))
}
```

## Next Steps

In the next post, we'll explore how to add middleware, handle forms, and work with databases in Fiber applications.

> Remember: Always handle errors properly in production applications!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
